    The Industrial Objects in Varied Contexts (InVar)
Dataset was internally produced by our team and contains
100 objects in 20800 total images (208 images per class).
The objects consist of common automotive, machine and
robotics lab parts. Each class contains 4 sub-categories (52
images each) with different attributes and visual complex-
ities. White background (Dwh): The object is against a
clean white background and the object is clear, centred and
in focus. Stationary Setup (Dst): These images are also
taken against a clean background using a stationary camera
setup, with uncentered objects at a constant distance. The
images have lower DPI resolution with occasional crop-
ping. Handheld (Dha): These images are taken with the
user holding the objects, with occasional occluding. Clut-
tered background (Dcl): These images are taken with the
object placed along with other objects from the lab in the
background and no occlusion. The InVar-100 dataset can be accessed here: http://dx.doi.org/10.24406/fordatis/266
